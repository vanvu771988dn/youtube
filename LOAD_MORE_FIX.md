# Load More Button Fix

## Issue
The "Load More" button was disappearing after applying filters, preventing users from loading additional pages of results.

## Root Cause

The `hasMore` calculation in the aggregator (`youtube/lib/aggregator.ts`) was too restrictive. It only returned `true` if:

1. There were leftover videos in the buffer, OR
2. There was a `nextPageToken` from the YouTube API

**Problem**: When the aggregator hit its safety page limit (max pages to fetch), it would stop fetching and set `hasMore` to `false`, even though more results might be available from the API.

### Before Fix
```typescript
const hasMore = ytPaginationState.get(key)!.buffer.length > 0 || !!ytPaginationState.get(key)!.nextPageToken;
```

This caused issues when:
- The aggregator fetched exactly the requested number of videos
- No buffer remained after slicing
- The `nextPageToken` was cleared or undefined
- Result: `hasMore = false` → Load More button disappeared

## Solution

Enhanced the `hasMore` calculation to also return `true` if the aggregator hit its safety page limit but still collected enough results:

### After Fix
```typescript
const hasMore = remainingBuffer.length > 0 || 
                !!updatedState.nextPageToken || 
                (safetyPages === 0 && pool.length >= filters.limit);
```

Now `hasMore` is `true` if ANY of these conditions are met:

1. **Buffer has leftover videos**: `remainingBuffer.length > 0`
2. **API has more pages**: `!!updatedState.nextPageToken`
3. **Hit safety limit with full results**: `safetyPages === 0 && pool.length >= filters.limit`

The third condition ensures that if we hit the maximum number of pages we're allowed to fetch BUT we still met our target, we assume more results are likely available.

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging

**In Aggregator** (`aggregator.ts` line 278):
```typescript
console.log(`[Aggregator] hasMore calculation: buffer=${remainingBuffer.length}, nextToken=${!!updatedState.nextPageToken}, safetyPagesHit=${safetyPages === 0}, result=${hasMore}`);
```

**In useTrends Hook** (`useTrends.ts` line 109):
```typescript
console.log(`[useTrends] Setting hasMore to: ${response.meta.hasMore} (page: ${currentPage}, videos returned: ${response.data.length})`);
```

**In VideoGrid Component** (`VideoGrid.tsx` line 88):
```typescript
console.log('[VideoGrid] Render state:', { videosCount: videos.length, loading, hasMore, error: !!error });
```

### 2. Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Open the app** in your browser
2. **Open DevTools Console** (F12)
3. **Apply multiple filters** (e.g., duration + view count + subscribers)
4. **Scroll to bottom** and look for the "Load More" button
5. **Check console logs** for hasMore calculations

Expected console output:
```
[Aggregator] hasMore calculation: buffer=0, nextToken=true, safetyPagesHit=false, result=true
[useTrends] Setting hasMore to: true (page: 1, videos returned: 50)
[VideoGrid] Render state: { videosCount: 50, loading: false, hasMore: true, error: false }
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Exact Limit Match
- **Scenario**: Aggregator fetches exactly `limit` videos, no buffer left
- **Before**: `hasMore = false` (button disappears)
- **After**: `hasMore = true` if `nextPageToken` exists or safety limit hit

### Case 2: Hit Safety Page Limit
- **Scenario**: Aggregator hits max pages (e.g., 50 pages with 3+ filters)
- **Before**: `hasMore = false` if no buffer/token
- **After**: `hasMore = true` since we hit limit with full results

### Case 3: No More Results from API
- **Scenario**: YouTube API returns no `nextPageToken`, buffer empty
- **Before**: `hasMore = false` ✓ (correct)
- **After**: `hasMore = false` ✓ (still correct)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load More button appears on initial load (when hasMore = true)
- [ ] Load More button works when clicked
- [ ] Load More button disappears when no more results (hasMore = false)
- [ ] Load More button persists through filter changes
- [ ] Console logs show correct hasMore calculations
- [ ] Button shows loading state while fetching
- [ ] Works with multiple active filters
- [ ] Works with single filter
- [ ] Works with no filters (trending)

## Known Limitations

1. **Safety Page Limit**: The aggregator still stops after a maximum number of pages (10-50 depending on filters) to prevent excessive API calls
2. **YouTube API Quotas**: Aggressive pagination can consume API quota quickly
3. **Performance**: Fetching many pages can slow down the app

## Future Enhancements

1. **Infinite Scroll**: Add IntersectionObserver to auto-load on scroll
2. **Virtualization**: Use react-window for better performance with large lists
3. **Progressive Loading**: Show intermediate results while fetching
4. **Smart Caching**: Cache pagination state across filter changes
