### üîÑ Changed

#### Architecture

### üêõ Fixed

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Smarter cache invalidation

### üìù Migration Notes

#### Breaking Changes
**useFilters Hook**
```typescript
// Before
const { filters, onFilterChange } = useFilters();

// After  
const { 
  filters, 
  onFilterChange,
  onVideoFilterChange,    // NEW
  onChannelFilterChange   // NEW
} = useFilters();
```

**FilterBar Component**
```typescript
// Before
<FilterBar 
  filters={filters}
  onFilterChange={onFilterChange}
/>

// After
<FilterBar 
  filters={filters}
  onFilterChange={onFilterChange}
  onVideoFilterChange={onVideoFilterChange}      // NEW
  onChannelFilterChange={onChannelFilterChange}  // NEW
/>
```

**API Response in Channel Mode**
- Results are now deduplicated by channel
- One video per unique channel returned
- Use Video mode for all videos from all channels
